                    <h2>Description</h2>
                        
                        <p>Baked mac and cheese. It’s nearly the universal comfort food, 
                            and there are SO many variations!  In fact, I almost didn’t post 
                            this recipe, as there are SOOOO many mac and cheese recipes available,
                            and most people already have their favorite way of making it.</p>
                        <p>Of course, there’s no “right” way or “wrong” way, so I’m here sharing 
                            the way I like to make my mac and cheese (the way my family loves it too).</p>
                        <p>If you’ve never made homemade mac and cheese before, it can seem a bit daunting. 
                            But don’t worry, we’ll break it down and take it step by step!</p>
                    
                    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                            <li>.5 cup all purpose flour</li>
                            <li>1.5 cups whole milk</li>
                            <li>2.5 cups half & half</li>
                            <li>4 cups shredded medium cheddar cheese (amount is post shred)</li>
                            <li>2 cups shredded Gruyere cheeese</li>
                            <li>.5 Tbsp salt</li>
                            <li>.5 tsp black pepper</li>
                            <li>.25 tsp paprika</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Preparation</h2>
                        <ol>
                            
                            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 qt baking dish (9x13"). 
                                Set aside.</li>
                            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When boiling, add dried 
                                pasta and cook 1 minute less than the package directs for al dente.  
                                Drain and drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to keep from sticking.</li>
                            <li>While water is coming up to a boil, shred cheeses and toss together to mix,
                                then divide into three piles. Approximately 3 cups for the sauce, 1 1/2 cups
                                for the inner layer, and 1 1/2 cups for the topping.</li>                
                            <li>While water is coming up to a boil, shred cheeses and toss together to mix,
                                then divide into three piles. Approximately 3 cups for the sauce, 1 1/2 cups
                                for the inner layer, and 1 1/2 cups for the topping.</li>
                            <li>Continue to heat over MED heat, whisking very often, until thickened to a 
                                very thick consistency.  It should almost be the consistency of a semi thinned
                                out condensed soup.</li>
                            <li>Remove from the heat and stir in spices and 1 1/2 cups of the cheeses, stirring 
                                to melt and combine.  Stir in another 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and stir until 
                                completely melted and smooth.</li>
                            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, stirring to combine
                                fully.  Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish.  
                                Top with 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheeses, then top that with the remaining pasta mixture.</li>
                            <li>Sprinkle the top with the last 1 1/2 cups of cheese and bake for 15 minutes, until 
                            cheese is bubbly and lightly golden brown.</li>
