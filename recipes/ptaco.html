    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These <em>delicious</em> tacos are a staple of my lunchtime cravings.
    They are very simple to make, technically requiring nothing but instant potatoes, corn tortillas and oil.
    Obviously there are practically infinite topping options: cheese, salsa, hummus, cilantro, guac, and lots of different
    sauces.</p>

        <p>These tacos also keep for about a week, meaning a busy, hungry individual can pack 3 or 4 of these
    on a weekend for lunches throughout the week. I recommend keeping toppings in their <strong>own</strong> separate 
    containers until lunchtime, avoiding shell sog.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Instant potatoes, prepared </li>
                <li> Corn tortillas</li>
                <li> Vegetable or olive oil</li>
                <li> (Optional)1-2 avocados, pitted and sliced into 1" widths</li>
                <li> (Optional)Salsa of your choice</li>
                <li> (Optional)Cheese (I like mexican style and mozz) </li>
            </ul>
    <h2>To make</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare potatoes according
                    to package directions. 1-2 tsp of water makes a noticeable difference
                    in potato texture, so prep according to preference.</li>
                <li>Drop 1-2 Tbsp oil into a large, flat pan over medium heat.
                    Wait for oil to spread across pan evenly.</li>
                <li>Lay corn tortillas on pan 1 or 2 at a time for about 20 seconds, until
                    evidently more pliable when lifted.
                <li>Drop taco sized amount of potato onto tortilla, fold in half and cook for 2-3 minutes until 
                    shell is light or medium brown and stiff.
                <li> Repeat with preffered amount of tacos.</li>
            </ol>
