    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fajitas are a wonderfully warm and comforting food
        that also provides lots of flavor. This vegan version
        gives us the meatiness that we <strong>crave</strong> and keeps the 
        bell peppers and spices intact. If you make other vegan recipes, the
        various oil choices and toppings given here will provide flavor variants
        that are sure to make your lunch or dinner memorable.</p>

        <p>The cashew cream option is a <em>deliciously</em> vegan way to get ones cream
        cheese fix. For those hoping to low carb, subsitute the flour tortillas
        for corn for a less fluffy yet no less delicious experience.</p>
